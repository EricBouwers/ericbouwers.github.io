  abstract = { Measuring the internal quality of source code is one of the traditional
    goals of making software development into an engineering discipline.
    Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is an often used source code quality metric, next
    to Source Lines of Code (SLOC). However, the use of the CC metric is
    challenged by the repeated claim that CC is redundant with respect to SLOC
    due to strong linear correlation.

    We conducted an extensive literature study of the CC/SLOC correlation results.
    Next, we tested correlation on large Java (17.6 M methods) and C (6.4 M
    functions) corpora. Our results show that linear correlation between SLOC and CC
    is only moderate, as caused by increasingly high variance. We further observe
    that aggregating CC and SLOC as well as performing a power transform improves
    the correlation.

    Our conclusion is that the observed linear correlation between CC and SLOC
    of Java methods or C functions is not strong enough to conclude that CC is
    redundant with SLOC. This conclusion contradicts earlier claims from
    literature, but concurs with the widely accepted practice of measuring of CC
    next to SLOC.
